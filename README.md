## Project Overview  
This project aims to segment customers of a business into distinct groups based on their behavioural and demographic patterns.  
By applying clustering algorithms, the goal is to enable targeted marketing, personalised offers, and better understanding of customer needs.

## Key Features  
- Data preprocessing: cleaning, normalisation, feature engineering  
- Clustering: application of K-Means (and optionally other clustering methods)  
- Cluster profiling: analysing each segment’s characteristics (e.g., age, spending, tenure)  
- Business recommendations: derived insights for marketing/strategy based on segment behaviour  

## Dataset  
- Source: *[provide dataset name or source]*  
- Key features include:  
  - CustomerID  
  - Age  
  - Annual Income  
  - Spending Score  
  - Tenure  
  - (Add any other features used)  
- Number of records: *e.g., 2,000 customers*  
- Note: Ensure dataset is placed into the `data/` folder (or adjust as necessary
